## Frequently Asked Questions About Safety Seals

### Does every product need a safety seal?

No. Federal regulations require tamper-evident packaging for specific categories of products, primarily **over-the-counter (OTC) drugs** (21 CFR 211.132), certain **cosmetic products** (21 CFR 700.25), and **dietary supplements**. Many other products -- such as beverages, condiments, and packaged foods -- use tamper-evident packaging voluntarily because consumers expect it and because it provides an extra layer of safety. Products like fresh produce, bakery items, and many household goods are not required to have tamper-evident packaging.

### What should I do if the seal is broken when I buy a product?

**Do not use the product.** Return it to the retailer for a refund or exchange and let the store staff know so they can check other units on the shelf. If the product appears to have been intentionally tampered with (signs of being opened and resealed, unusual appearance or smell), report it to the FDA's MedWatch program at **1-800-FDA-1088** and consider contacting local law enforcement. For detailed steps, see our guide on [How to Report Tampering](/learn/how-to-report-tampering).

### Can I still use a product if the outer seal is broken but the inner seal is intact?

It depends on the circumstances. If the outer seal (such as the shrink wrap on a box) is broken but the inner seal (such as the foil seal under a bottle cap) is fully intact and undisturbed, the product may still be safe. However, the safest course of action is to **return the product and get a replacement**. A broken outer seal, even if the inner seal appears intact, means one layer of your protection has been compromised. If you are uncertain, err on the side of caution.

### Are safety seals the same as child-resistant packaging?

No, they serve different purposes. **Tamper-evident packaging** is designed to show whether a product has been opened or interfered with. **Child-resistant packaging** (regulated by the Consumer Product Safety Commission under the Poison Prevention Packaging Act, 16 CFR 1700) is designed to make it difficult for children under five years old to open a product. A product can have one, both, or neither. For example, a bottle of ibuprofen typically has both a child-resistant cap and a foil inner seal. The child-resistant cap prevents kids from opening it; the foil seal shows whether an adult has already opened it.

### What products are exempt from tamper-evident packaging requirements?

Under 21 CFR 211.132, the following OTC products are exempt from tamper-evident packaging requirements:

- **Dermatological products** (creams, ointments, lotions) that are applied to the skin and have a net quantity of contents of not more than 3.5 grams or milliliters
- Products that are **physically unable to support tamper-evident features** due to their size or packaging type (though this exemption is narrow and rarely invoked)
- Products packaged in containers that are inherently tamper-evident by design (e.g., sealed single-dose ampules)

Additionally, **prescription medications** dispensed by a pharmacist are generally exempt because they are handled by a professional and are not accessible to the public on open shelves.

### How do I know what type of seal my product should have?

Check the product label. Federal regulations require manufacturers to include a statement on the label that **identifies the specific tamper-evident feature(s)** and tells you not to use the product if that feature is missing or broken. Look for text like "Do not use if foil seal under cap is broken or missing" or "Do not use if blister pack is torn or opened." If there is no such statement on a product that you believe should be sealed, that itself may be a concern worth reporting. For a visual guide to different seal types, see [Types of Tamper-Evident Packaging](/learn/types-of-tamper-evident-packaging).

### What is the difference between tamper-evident and tamper-proof?

**Tamper-evident** packaging is designed to show evidence that someone has opened or interfered with a product. **Tamper-proof** packaging would, in theory, prevent tampering entirely. In practice, no packaging is truly tamper-proof -- a determined individual can eventually defeat any physical barrier. This is why the industry and regulations use the term "tamper-evident" rather than "tamper-proof." The goal is not to make tampering impossible but to make it **visible**.

### Do international products have the same seal requirements?

Not necessarily. Tamper-evident packaging requirements vary by country. The regulations described on this site (21 CFR 211.132, 21 CFR 700.25, 18 U.S.C. Section 1365) are **U.S. federal regulations**. The European Union, Canada, Australia, Japan, and other jurisdictions have their own standards, which may be similar in spirit but differ in specifics. If you purchase a product manufactured outside the United States, it must still comply with U.S. regulations if it is sold in the U.S. However, products purchased abroad (such as during travel) may not meet U.S. standards. When in doubt, check the packaging carefully and look for familiar tamper-evident features.

### Can a store sell products with broken seals?

**No.** Under federal regulations, OTC drug products, dietary supplements, and regulated cosmetics must have intact tamper-evident features at the point of sale. A retailer that knowingly sells products with broken seals is in violation of FDA regulations and could face enforcement action. If you find a product with a broken seal on a store shelf, bring it to the attention of store management. If the store refuses to address the problem, you can file a complaint with the FDA or your state attorney general.

### Should I check seals before or after purchasing?

**Both.** Check the outer packaging (shrink wrap, film wrapper, box flaps, neckband) **before** purchasing while you are still in the store. This is your first opportunity to catch problems and simply choose a different unit. Then check the inner seals (foil seals, membrane seals, vacuum buttons) **after** purchasing when you open the product at home. If you find a problem at that point, do not use the product and return it to the store.

### What if a product looks like it has been opened and resealed?

Take this seriously. Signs of resealing include misaligned labels, uneven shrink wrap, re-glued box flaps, foil seals that appear wrinkled or repositioned, or packaging that looks subtly different from identical products on the shelf. **Do not use the product.** Return it to the retailer and report it. If you suspect intentional tampering, contact the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 and your local law enforcement. See [How to Report Tampering](/learn/how-to-report-tampering) for detailed instructions on preserving evidence and filing reports.

### Do online purchases need the same seals as in-store purchases?

Yes. The tamper-evident packaging requirements under 21 CFR 211.132 and other regulations apply to the **product**, not the point of sale. Whether you buy an OTC medication in a brick-and-mortar pharmacy or from an online retailer, the product must have the same tamper-evident features. When you receive products ordered online, inspect the tamper-evident packaging just as carefully as you would in a store -- perhaps even more so, since the product has gone through a shipping process that may have jostled or damaged it.

### Are dietary supplements required to have safety seals?

Yes. Dietary supplements are regulated under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) and are subject to current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations. The FDA applies tamper-evident packaging requirements to dietary supplements in a manner consistent with OTC drug requirements. If you purchase a dietary supplement and it does not have a tamper-evident seal, that is a red flag about the manufacturer's compliance with federal regulations.

### What about products from farmers markets or small manufacturers?

The same federal regulations technically apply to all manufacturers, regardless of size. However, enforcement at farmers markets and for very small producers can be inconsistent. Products sold at farmers markets are often exempt from certain packaging requirements depending on state law and the type of product (for example, home-baked goods or fresh produce). If you buy something like a homemade salsa or a small-batch supplement at a farmers market, be aware that it may not have the same tamper-evident packaging as a mass-produced product. This does not mean the product is unsafe -- just that you should evaluate it on its own terms and buy from vendors you trust.

### Who is responsible if I get sick from a tampered product?

Multiple parties could bear legal responsibility. **The person who tampered with the product** is criminally liable under the Federal Anti-Tampering Act (18 U.S.C. Section 1365). Beyond that, depending on the circumstances, you may have civil claims against the **manufacturer** (for inadequate tamper-evident packaging or quality control failures), the **retailer** (for selling a product with a compromised seal), or the **distributor** (for failures in the supply chain). If you are harmed by a tampered product, consult a personal injury attorney in addition to reporting the incident to the FDA and law enforcement.

### How can I tell if a vacuum seal button has been reset?

This is a concern worth knowing about. A vacuum seal button (the pop-up indicator on jar lids) works because the vacuum inside the sealed jar holds the button down. If someone opens the jar, the vacuum is released and the button pops up. In theory, it is possible to create a new vacuum seal by heating the jar or its contents -- but doing so would typically leave evidence: the contents may appear disturbed, the lid may have marks or residue from being removed and replaced, and the safety button may not depress with quite the same firmness as a factory-sealed button. **Compare the button to identical products on the shelf.** If it feels different -- looser, clickier, or already slightly raised -- choose a different jar.

### Are there safety seal requirements for pet medications?

OTC pet medications that are regulated by the FDA (such as certain flea treatments and dewormers) generally must comply with the same tamper-evident packaging standards as human OTC drugs. However, many pet products are regulated differently -- some fall under the EPA (such as flea collars and topical pesticides) or are considered animal feed additives under different FDA divisions. The patchwork of regulation means that tamper-evident packaging on pet products is not as universal or consistent as it is for human OTC drugs. Always inspect pet medications and supplements before administering them to your animals.

### What is the penalty for product tampering?

Under the **Federal Anti-Tampering Act (18 U.S.C. Section 1365)**, the penalties are:

- **Tampering that results in death:** Up to **life in prison**
- **Tampering that results in serious bodily injury:** Up to **20 years** in prison
- **Attempted tampering:** Up to **10 years** in prison
- **Threats of tampering:** Up to **10 years** in prison
- **Communicating false information about tampering:** Up to **5 years** in prison

These are federal charges prosecuted by the U.S. Department of Justice. State laws may impose additional penalties. The severity of these punishments reflects Congress's intent, following the 1982 Tylenol murders, to treat product tampering as one of the most serious crimes against public safety.

### Do prescription medications need tamper-evident packaging?

The 21 CFR 211.132 tamper-evident packaging requirement applies specifically to OTC human drug products -- that is, products accessible to consumers on store shelves without a prescription. **Prescription medications dispensed by a pharmacist** are generally exempt because the pharmacist serves as an intermediary who can verify the integrity of the product before handing it to the patient. However, prescription medications in their original manufacturer packaging (before they reach the pharmacy) are typically sealed. If you pick up a prescription and the packaging appears disturbed, ask your pharmacist about it.

### How often are products actually tampered with?

Intentional product tampering is **extremely rare**. The combination of tamper-evident packaging, federal criminal penalties, store security systems, supply chain monitoring, and consumer vigilance has made successful tampering very difficult to carry out without detection. The FDA receives reports of packaging concerns through MedWatch, but the vast majority of these involve manufacturing defects or shipping damage rather than deliberate tampering. While exact statistics are not published in a single public database, experts in consumer safety consistently describe intentional tampering as a very low-probability event. That said, the consequences of tampering can be severe, which is exactly why the safety infrastructure exists -- even rare events justify robust protections.
