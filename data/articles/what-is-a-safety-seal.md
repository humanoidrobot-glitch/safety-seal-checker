## What is a Safety Seal?

A safety seal, formally known as **tamper-evident packaging**, is a feature built into a product's container or wrapper that makes it easy for you to tell whether someone has opened or interfered with the product before you bought it. The key word is "evident" -- the packaging is designed so that any attempt to open it leaves behind visible, irreversible signs.

Safety seals are not locks. They cannot prevent someone from opening a product. Instead, they serve as a clear visual indicator that a product has remained sealed since it left the manufacturer. Think of it like the wax seal on an old-fashioned letter: it does not stop anyone from reading the letter, but breaking it proves someone has.

### Why Do Safety Seals Exist?

The widespread adoption of tamper-evident packaging traces back to a single, tragic event: the **1982 Chicago Tylenol murders**. In September and October of that year, seven people in the Chicago metropolitan area died after taking Extra-Strength Tylenol capsules that had been laced with potassium cyanide. Someone had removed bottles of Tylenol from store shelves, added the poison to individual capsules, and then placed the bottles back on the shelves for unsuspecting customers to buy.

The case, which remains unsolved to this day, sent shockwaves through the nation. Johnson & Johnson, Tylenol's manufacturer, voluntarily recalled approximately 31 million bottles of the product -- an unprecedented move at the time. More importantly, the tragedy exposed a critical gap in consumer safety: there was no standard way for a customer to know whether a product had been opened before they bought it.

In direct response, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) enacted emergency regulations requiring tamper-evident packaging for over-the-counter (OTC) medications. These rules were later codified as **21 CFR 211.132**, and they permanently changed how consumer products are packaged. Congress also passed the **Federal Anti-Tampering Act of 1983**, making product tampering a federal crime punishable by up to life in prison.

For a more detailed account of these events, see our article on the [History of Tamper-Evident Packaging](/learn/history-of-tamper-evident-packaging).

### What Products Require Safety Seals?

Federal regulations require tamper-evident packaging on several categories of consumer products:

- **Over-the-counter (OTC) medications** -- This includes pain relievers, cold medicine, antacids, eye drops, and virtually all non-prescription drugs sold to consumers. This requirement comes from 21 CFR 211.132.
- **Cosmetics** -- Certain liquid cosmetic products that could be vulnerable to contamination must use tamper-evident packaging, as outlined in 21 CFR 700.25. This includes items like mouthwash, skin lotions, and eye-area products.
- **Dietary supplements** -- Under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) and associated regulations, dietary supplements follow the same tamper-evident packaging requirements as OTC drugs.
- **Contact lens care products** -- Solutions, cleaners, and other products that come into direct contact with your eyes must have tamper-evident features.
- **Food products** -- While not always required by the same regulations, many food products use tamper-evident packaging voluntarily or as required by other FDA food safety regulations. Infant formula, for example, must have tamper-evident packaging.

Many manufacturers go beyond what is legally required, adding safety seals to products like beverages, condiments, cleaning supplies, and more -- simply because consumers have come to expect them.

### How to Check for a Proper Seal

Checking safety seals should become a quick habit every time you purchase a product. Here is what to look for:

- **Before you buy:** Examine the outer packaging in the store. Look at the shrink wrap, box flaps, or neckband. If anything appears torn, loose, punctured, or different from identical products on the shelf, choose a different one.
- **When you open the product at home:** Check for inner seals before using the product. Many OTC medications have a foil seal under the cap or a sealed inner membrane. If the inner seal is missing, torn, or looks like it has been tampered with, do not use the product.
- **Compare with what you know:** Most products describe their tamper-evident features on the label. You might see a statement like "Do not use if foil seal under cap is broken or missing." Read and follow these instructions.
- **Check vacuum seals:** Some jars have a raised "safety button" on the lid. If the button is popped up (rather than flat or slightly concave), the vacuum seal may have been broken.
- **Look for consistency:** If a shrink band is applied unevenly, a cap ring appears glued back on, or packaging looks noticeably different from the same product you have bought before, treat it with caution.

### What to Do If a Seal Is Missing or Broken

Finding a broken or missing seal can be alarming, but it does not always mean foul play. Sometimes seals break during shipping or handling. Regardless, here is what you should do:

1. **Do not use the product.** Even if the broken seal was likely accidental, it is not worth the risk.
2. **Return it to the store.** Bring the product back to the retailer where you purchased it. You are entitled to a refund or exchange. Most stores handle these returns without any hassle.
3. **Alert the store staff.** Let them know you found a broken seal so they can check other items on the shelf. If multiple products are affected, the store may need to pull the entire batch.
4. **Report it if you suspect intentional tampering.** If the product looks like it has been deliberately opened and resealed, or if there is something unusual about its contents (strange color, odor, or consistency), contact the FDA's MedWatch program at **1-800-FDA-1088** and your local law enforcement. See our detailed guide on [How to Report Tampering](/learn/how-to-report-tampering).
5. **Preserve the product.** If you suspect intentional tampering, do not throw the product away. Place it in a sealed plastic bag and keep it for investigators.

### Safety Seals Are a Partnership

Tamper-evident packaging works best when manufacturers, retailers, and consumers all play their part. Manufacturers design and apply the seals. Retailers keep products secure on their shelves and respond when problems are found. And you, the consumer, complete the chain by checking those seals before use.

The good news is that product tampering is extremely rare. The regulations and packaging technologies that emerged after 1982 have been remarkably effective. But the entire system depends on people paying attention. A quick check every time you open a new product is one of the simplest things you can do to protect yourself and your family.
