## Your Rights as a Consumer

When it comes to product safety and tamper-evident packaging, federal law is squarely on your side. A network of regulations, enforcement agencies, and legal protections exists to ensure that the products you buy are safe, sealed, and free from tampering. Understanding your rights empowers you to take action when something does not seem right.

### Federal Regulations That Protect You

Several key regulations require manufacturers to use tamper-evident packaging on consumer products:

**21 CFR 211.132 -- Tamper-Evident Packaging Requirements for OTC Drugs**

This is the cornerstone regulation. Enacted by the FDA in the wake of the 1982 Tylenol poisoning tragedy, it requires that all over-the-counter (OTC) human drug products be packaged using tamper-evident features. Specifically, the regulation mandates that:

- Each OTC drug product must have **at least one** tamper-evident packaging feature.
- The packaging must be designed so that if tampering occurs, there will be **visible evidence** to the consumer.
- The product label must include a **statement** identifying the tamper-evident feature(s) and instructing consumers not to use the product if the feature appears disturbed. For example: "Do not use if foil seal under cap is broken or missing."
- Two-piece capsule products must use **at least two** tamper-evident features, unless the capsules are sealed (e.g., banded or sealed capsules).

**21 CFR 700.25 -- Tamper-Resistant Packaging for Cosmetic Products**

This regulation extends tamper-evident requirements to certain cosmetic products. It applies to any cosmetic product that is readily accessible to the public and could be at risk of contamination. Covered products include liquid face care products, eye-area cosmetics, and products applied to mucous membranes. Under this rule, these cosmetics must have tamper-resistant packaging with an indicator or barrier to entry that, if breached or missing, can reasonably be expected to provide visible evidence to consumers.

**The Federal Anti-Tampering Act (18 U.S.C. Section 1365)**

Passed by Congress in 1983, this law makes it a **federal crime** to tamper with, or attempt to tamper with, any consumer product. The penalties are severe:

- **Tampering that results in death:** Up to **life in prison**.
- **Tampering that results in serious bodily injury:** Up to **20 years** in prison.
- **Attempted tampering or tampering threats:** Up to **10 years** in prison.
- **Knowingly communicating false information about tampering:** Up to **5 years** in prison.

This law also covers threats of tampering and applies to products that affect interstate or foreign commerce, which in practice means virtually every consumer product sold in the United States.

**The Poison Prevention Packaging Act (PPPA) -- 16 CFR 1700**

While this is primarily about child-resistant packaging (which is different from tamper-evident packaging), it overlaps with consumer safety. The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) enforces this act, which requires certain household products and medications to have child-resistant closures. It is important to note that child-resistant packaging and tamper-evident packaging serve different purposes -- one prevents children from opening a product, while the other shows whether anyone has opened it.

### What the Law Requires Manufacturers to Do

Under these regulations, manufacturers must:

- **Design tamper-evident packaging** that provides a visual indication of tampering.
- **Label their products** with a description of the tamper-evident feature and instructions not to use the product if the feature is breached.
- **Use at least two tamper-evident features** on two-piece hard gelatin capsule products.
- **Maintain quality controls** during manufacturing to ensure tamper-evident features are properly applied.
- **Report** any known instances of tampering to the FDA.

### Your Right to Return Products

You have the right to return any product that has a broken, missing, or compromised tamper-evident seal. Here is what you need to know:

- **Retailers are generally required to accept returns** of products with broken seals. Most major retailers have explicit policies allowing refunds or exchanges for such products.
- **You do not need a receipt in many cases.** While a receipt makes the process smoother, many retailers will accept returns of sealed products that are clearly from their inventory.
- **There is no time limit imposed by federal law** for returning a product with a compromised seal, though individual retailers may have return windows. The key is that the product should never have been sold in that condition.
- **You should not feel pressured to keep the product.** If a store employee pushes back, ask to speak with a manager and explain that the tamper-evident seal was compromised.

### How to File Complaints

If you encounter a product with a compromised seal, you have multiple avenues for filing a complaint depending on the severity of the situation:

**FDA MedWatch (for drugs, supplements, cosmetics, and medical devices)**

- **Phone:** 1-800-FDA-1088
- **Online:** [https://www.fda.gov/safety/medwatch](https://www.fda.gov/safety/medwatch)
- **What to report:** Missing or broken seals on OTC medications, dietary supplements, cosmetics, or any product regulated by the FDA. Also report any adverse health effects.
- MedWatch is the FDA's primary safety reporting program, and your report may trigger an investigation or a product recall.

**Federal Trade Commission (FTC)**

- **Online:** [https://reportfraud.ftc.gov](https://reportfraud.ftc.gov)
- **What to report:** Deceptive packaging practices, misleading labeling about tamper-evident features, or products sold without required safety seals.

**Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC)**

- **Online:** [https://www.saferproducts.gov](https://www.saferproducts.gov)
- **Phone:** 1-800-638-2772
- **What to report:** Safety concerns about consumer products, including those related to packaging integrity. The CPSC handles products that are not drugs or cosmetics, such as household goods.

**Your State Attorney General**

- Every state has a consumer protection division within the attorney general's office. If you believe a retailer or manufacturer is systematically selling products with compromised seals, your state attorney general can investigate.
- Search online for "[your state] attorney general consumer complaint" to find the appropriate form or phone number.

**The Retailer**

- Always start by notifying the store where you purchased the product. They can pull affected products from the shelf to protect other consumers, and they can escalate the issue to the manufacturer and distributor.

**The Product Manufacturer**

- Most products have a customer service phone number or website on the label. Contact the manufacturer directly to report the issue. They may issue a voluntary recall or investigate their supply chain.

### When to Contact Law Enforcement

Most cases of broken or missing seals are the result of manufacturing defects or shipping damage, not intentional tampering. However, you should contact your **local police department** if:

- The product appears to have been **deliberately opened and resealed**.
- The contents look, smell, or feel different from what you would expect (unusual color, strange odor, unexpected texture, foreign objects).
- You or someone in your household has experienced **adverse health effects** after using the product.
- You find **multiple products** on the same shelf with compromised seals, suggesting a pattern rather than an accident.

In cases of suspected intentional tampering, law enforcement may involve the **FBI**, since product tampering is a federal crime under 18 U.S.C. Section 1365.

If you or anyone is in immediate danger from a potentially contaminated product, call **911** first, then **Poison Control at 1-800-222-1222**.

### You Are an Essential Part of the Safety System

Federal regulations create the framework, and manufacturers build the packaging, but **you are the last line of defense**. Every time you check a seal before using a product, you are completing a safety chain that stretches from the factory floor to your home. If something seems wrong, trust your instincts and take action. The system is designed to support you.
