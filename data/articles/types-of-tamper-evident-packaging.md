## Types of Tamper-Evident Packaging

Not all safety seals are created equal. Different products use different types of tamper-evident packaging depending on the container shape, the product inside, and the level of protection needed. Many products use **two or more types** simultaneously -- for example, a bottle of pain reliever might have a shrink-wrapped outer box, a breakable cap ring, and a foil inner seal under the lid.

This guide covers every major type of tamper-evident packaging you are likely to encounter as a consumer. For each type, we describe what it looks like, what products typically use it, how to verify it, and what tampering may look like.

---

### 1. Foil Inner Seals (Induction Seals)

**What it looks like:** A thin layer of metallic foil glued across the opening of a bottle or jar, sitting directly under the cap. You peel it off or puncture it to access the product. Some foil seals are printed with the brand name or the phrase "Sealed for your protection."

**Products that use it:** OTC medications (pain relievers, vitamins, supplements), beverages (juices, sports drinks), condiments (ketchup, mayonnaise), infant formula.

**How to check it:** After removing the cap, the foil should be flat, fully adhered to the rim, and unbroken. It should require some effort to peel away.

**What tampering looks like:** The foil is torn, wrinkled, partially peeled, or missing entirely. The adhesive around the edges may look disturbed, or the foil may appear to have been reapplied (unevenly placed, with bubbles or creases).

---

### 2. Shrink Bands

**What it looks like:** A thin plastic band wrapped tightly around the junction where the cap meets the bottle. The band is heat-shrunk to conform to the shape of the container. When you twist the cap open for the first time, the band tears or separates.

**Products that use it:** Bottled beverages (water, juice, soda), hot sauce, salad dressings, some OTC liquid medications.

**How to check it:** The band should be smooth, tight, and unbroken. It should sit snugly against both the cap and the bottle neck without gaps.

**What tampering looks like:** The band is torn, missing, loose, or appears to have been re-applied (wrinkled, uneven shrinkage, or not flush against the container). Compare with other identical products on the shelf if unsure.

---

### 3. Breakable Caps (Snap-Off or Twist-Off Rings)

**What it looks like:** A plastic or metal ring at the base of the cap that is connected by small perforated bridges. When you unscrew the cap for the first time, the ring snaps free and remains on the bottle neck. This is sometimes called a "pilfer-proof" or "tamper-evident" closure.

**Products that use it:** Bottled water, soft drinks, milk jugs, liquid medications, mouthwash, cooking oils.

**How to check it:** Before opening, the ring should be firmly attached to the cap with all the small connecting bridges intact. The cap should not spin freely without resistance.

**What tampering looks like:** The ring is already separated from the cap, the connecting bridges are broken, the cap spins freely, or the ring is missing. In some cases, a tampered cap may have been glued back together -- look for residue or misalignment.

---

### 4. Film Wrappers (Overwrap)

**What it looks like:** A clear or printed plastic film tightly wrapped around the entire product or its box. Think of the cellophane on a box of tea, a new video game, or a carton of cigarettes. It must be torn or cut to access the product.

**Products that use it:** Boxed OTC medications, tea, cosmetics, playing cards, electronics, some food products.

**How to check it:** The film should be smooth, tight, and free of tears or punctures. Look for the manufacturer's pull tab or tear strip -- a small tab designed to help you remove the wrap cleanly.

**What tampering looks like:** The film is torn, has holes, is wrinkled or loose, or appears to have been re-wrapped (different film quality, no pull tab, uneven seams). If the product is a box, check that the film covers all edges uniformly.

---

### 5. Blister Packs

**What it looks like:** Individual doses of a product (usually pills or capsules) sealed in small, pre-formed plastic cavities backed by foil or cardboard. You push the product through the backing to access each dose individually.

**Products that use it:** Many prescription and OTC medications (allergy pills, cold medicine, gum), batteries, small hardware items.

**How to check it:** Each individual cavity should be intact, with the foil or cardboard backing fully sealed. The plastic should not have any cracks, holes, or signs of being pried open.

**What tampering looks like:** One or more cavities have been pushed through and re-covered, the backing foil is wrinkled or torn, the plastic is cracked, or the seal between the plastic and backing appears disturbed.

---

### 6. Vacuum Seal Buttons (Pop-Up Indicators)

**What it looks like:** A small circular button or dome in the center of a metal jar lid. When the jar is properly vacuum-sealed, the button is concave (pressed down). When the seal is broken (either by opening or by tampering), the button pops up and becomes convex.

**Products that use it:** Jarred foods (pasta sauce, salsa, pickles, jam, baby food), some condiments.

**How to check it:** Press the center of the lid. If the jar is sealed, the button should be flat or slightly concave and should not flex up and down. When you hear a "pop" upon first opening, that confirms the vacuum seal was intact.

**What tampering looks like:** The button is already popped up before you open the jar, the lid does not "pop" when opened, or the button moves up and down freely when pressed (indicating the vacuum has been broken).

---

### 7. Tape Seals

**What it looks like:** Adhesive tape applied over the flaps, seams, or openings of a box or container. The tape may be plain or printed with a brand logo, pattern, or the word "SEALED." Some security tapes leave behind a "VOID" or "OPENED" message if someone tries to peel them off and reapply them.

**Products that use it:** Boxed OTC medications, some food packaging, electronics, shipped packages.

**How to check it:** The tape should be smooth, fully adhered, and unbroken. If it is security tape, look for any signs that it has been peeled and reapplied (the "VOID" pattern would be visible on the surface beneath).

**What tampering looks like:** The tape is torn, peeled, repositioned, or has wrinkles and bubbles suggesting re-application. On security tape, a "VOID" or "OPENED" message is visible on the box surface.

---

### 8. Sealed Sachets and Pouches

**What it looks like:** A fully sealed flexible pouch or sachet that contains the product. The entire package must be torn or cut open along a designated line. Once opened, it cannot be resealed to its original state.

**Products that use it:** Single-serve food items (sugar, ketchup, oatmeal), medication powders, wet wipes, some cosmetics.

**How to check it:** The sachet should be fully sealed on all edges, with no openings, punctures, or signs of resealing. If the product is pressurized or vacuum-sealed, the sachet should feel firm.

**What tampering looks like:** The edges are open, uneven, or appear to have been resealed (extra adhesive, heat marks, or misaligned edges). The sachet may feel unusually slack or deflated.

---

### 9. Glued Carton Flaps

**What it looks like:** The end flaps of a cardboard box are sealed shut with adhesive. Opening the box requires tearing the glued flaps apart, which visibly damages the carton. Many OTC medications come in boxes with glued end flaps.

**Products that use it:** OTC medication boxes, toothpaste, some food products, cosmetics.

**How to check it:** Both end flaps should be sealed. The glue bond should require noticeable effort to break. Look for the manufacturer's statement, which may say something like "Do not use if carton is open or if seal is broken."

**What tampering looks like:** One or both end flaps are open or loose, the carton shows signs of being re-glued (excess adhesive, warped cardboard from moisture or heat), or the flap edges are torn in an unusual pattern.

---

### 10. Neckbands

**What it looks like:** A thin plastic or paper band wrapped around the neck of a bottle, typically between the cap and the body. It is similar to a shrink band but may be applied separately. Some neckbands are printed with branding or "sealed for your protection."

**Products that use it:** Wine and spirits bottles, some sauces, specialty beverages, and some OTC liquids.

**How to check it:** The band should be intact and snugly fit around the bottle neck. It should tear cleanly when the bottle is first opened.

**What tampering looks like:** The band is missing, torn, loose, or shows evidence of having been re-applied. On bottles with wax or foil neckbands, look for cracking, peeling, or reapplication marks.

---

### 11. Inner Tube Seals (Membrane Seals)

**What it looks like:** A thin paper, plastic, or foil membrane sealed inside the neck of a tube (like a toothpaste tube or ointment tube). You typically puncture it with the pointed cap tip or a separate tool before first use.

**Products that use it:** Toothpaste, topical medications and ointments, adhesives, some cosmetics.

**How to check it:** When you first unscrew the cap, the tube opening should be fully sealed by the membrane. The membrane should be intact and undamaged.

**What tampering looks like:** The membrane is already punctured, missing, or partially torn. The tube may also feel partially squeezed if someone has accessed the product.

---

### 12. Printed Shrink Sleeves

**What it looks like:** A full-body plastic sleeve that is printed with product graphics and heat-shrunk to fit tightly over the entire container. Because the sleeve covers the whole product, any attempt to open or remove it creates visible distortion, tearing, or misalignment.

**Products that use it:** Bottled beverages, yogurt, dairy products, some OTC medications, cleaning products.

**How to check it:** The sleeve should fit smoothly and tightly around the container. The printed graphics should be properly aligned, with no wrinkles, tears, or shifting. There should be a designated tear strip or perforated area for opening.

**What tampering looks like:** The sleeve is wrinkled, torn, misaligned, or appears to have been removed and reapplied. The perforated tear strip may already be partially torn.

### A Note About Multiple Seal Types

Many products are designed with **layered tamper-evident features**. A bottle of ibuprofen, for instance, might have:

1. A film-wrapped outer box with glued end flaps
2. A breakable cap ring on the bottle
3. A foil induction seal under the cap
4. A printed message on the label describing all three features

This layered approach means that even if one seal is accidentally damaged during shipping, other layers of protection remain. As a consumer, you should check **all** layers, not just the most obvious one. If any layer shows signs of tampering, do not use the product.

For information about what to do when you encounter damaged or missing seals, see [What is a Safety Seal?](/learn/what-is-a-safety-seal) and [How to Report Tampering](/learn/how-to-report-tampering).
