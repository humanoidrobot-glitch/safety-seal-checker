## How to Report Tampering

If you discover a product with a broken, missing, or suspicious tamper-evident seal, knowing what to do next can make a real difference -- both for your safety and for the safety of other consumers. This guide walks you through the process step by step.

### Step 1: Assess the Situation

Not every broken seal is cause for alarm. Before taking action, consider the following:

**A missing or broken seal could be:**
- A manufacturing defect (the seal was never properly applied)
- Shipping or handling damage
- Accidental damage by another customer in the store
- Intentional tampering

**Signs that suggest intentional tampering:**
- The product appears to have been opened and carefully resealed
- The contents look, smell, or feel different from what you would expect (wrong color, unusual odor, unexpected texture, visible foreign material)
- Multiple products on the same shelf have compromised seals
- The packaging shows signs of being manipulated (re-glued flaps, reapplied shrink wrap, misaligned labels)

If there is any doubt, treat the situation seriously. It is always better to report something that turns out to be harmless than to ignore something that turns out to be dangerous.

### Step 2: Protect Yourself and Others

- **Do not use the product.** If you have not yet consumed or applied the product, stop. Do not taste, smell closely, or otherwise test the product yourself.
- **If someone has already used the product and feels ill,** call **911** immediately, then call **Poison Control at 1-800-222-1222**. Provide the product name, the suspected issue, and the symptoms.
- **Keep the product.** Do not throw it away. It may be needed as evidence.

### Step 3: Preserve the Evidence

If you suspect intentional tampering, how you handle the product matters:

- **Do not continue to handle the product unnecessarily.** Fingerprints and DNA evidence could be present on the packaging.
- **Place the product in a sealed plastic bag** (a zip-lock bag works well) and store it in a safe place away from children and pets.
- **Keep the receipt** if you have it. It establishes where and when the product was purchased.
- **Take photographs** of the product, the packaging, the seal (or where the seal should be), and the shelf where you found it. Photos taken with your phone are fine -- they automatically include date, time, and sometimes location data.
- **Write down what you remember** while the details are fresh: where you bought it, when you bought it, when you noticed the problem, and exactly what looked wrong.

### Step 4: Report It

Depending on the severity of the situation, you may need to contact several different parties. Here is who to contact and when:

#### The Retailer Where You Purchased the Product

**Contact them first in all cases.** Return to the store (or call) and explain what you found. Ask to speak with a manager. This accomplishes two things: it gets you a refund or replacement, and it alerts the store to check other products on the shelf. Ask the manager to set aside any other units of the same product for inspection.

#### FDA MedWatch

**Contact for:** Any product regulated by the FDA -- OTC medications, dietary supplements, cosmetics, contact lens solutions, and food products.

- **Phone:** 1-800-FDA-1088
- **Online:** [https://www.fda.gov/safety/medwatch](https://www.fda.gov/safety/medwatch)
- **Mail:** You can also submit a report via the MedWatch Voluntary Reporting Form (FDA Form 3500), which is available for download on the FDA website.

Your MedWatch report goes directly into the FDA's safety surveillance system. If multiple reports come in about the same product, it can trigger an FDA investigation or a product recall. Even if your individual case turns out to be a manufacturing defect, reporting it helps the FDA identify patterns.

#### Poison Control

**Contact for:** Any situation where someone may have been exposed to a contaminated product.

- **Phone:** 1-800-222-1222 (available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week)

Poison Control can provide immediate medical guidance and will also log the incident in the National Poison Data System, which helps health authorities identify emerging threats.

#### Local Law Enforcement

**Contact for:** Suspected intentional tampering.

- Call the **non-emergency number** for your local police department (or 911 if someone has been harmed).
- Explain that you have found what appears to be a tampered consumer product.
- Police can initiate a local investigation and, if warranted, involve the **FBI**, since product tampering is a federal crime under 18 U.S.C. Section 1365.

#### The Product Manufacturer

**Contact for:** All cases -- they need to know about seal failures, whether accidental or intentional.

- Most products have a customer service phone number or website printed on the label. Call or submit a report.
- The manufacturer may request that you send them the product for analysis. If law enforcement is already involved, check with them first before sending anything.

### Step 5: What Information to Gather Before Reporting

Having the following details ready will make your report more useful:

- **Product name and description** (brand, type, size, flavor/variety)
- **UPC code** (the barcode number on the packaging)
- **Lot number or batch number** (usually printed on the bottom or side of the container)
- **Expiration date**
- **Where you purchased it** (store name, address, and specific location within the store if you remember)
- **When you purchased it** (date and approximate time)
- **When you noticed the problem**
- **A description of what is wrong** (be as specific as possible -- "the foil seal under the cap was torn and partially re-adhered" is more helpful than "the seal was broken")
- **Whether anyone used the product** and, if so, whether they experienced any symptoms
- **Photos** of the product and packaging

### Step 6: What to Expect After Filing a Report

After you file a report, here is what typically happens:

- **Retailer:** The store will usually process your return immediately. Depending on the situation, they may pull the product from shelves and contact their distributor.
- **FDA MedWatch:** You will receive a confirmation that your report has been received. The FDA reviews all MedWatch reports but does not typically follow up with individual reporters unless they need additional information. If your report, combined with others, reveals a safety concern, the FDA may issue a public safety alert, mandate a recall, or initiate an inspection.
- **Law enforcement:** If you file a police report, an officer may come to collect the product as evidence. For suspected federal crimes, the case may be referred to the FBI. You may be contacted for follow-up questions.
- **Manufacturer:** The manufacturer's response varies. Many will thank you, offer product replacements or coupons, and conduct their own internal investigation. Some may ask for the product back for laboratory analysis.

### You Are Helping Protect Everyone

Filing a report is not an overreaction. The entire tamper-evident packaging system depends on consumers being willing to speak up when something seems wrong. Your report might prevent another person from using a dangerous product. It might reveal a manufacturing defect that affects thousands of units. Or it might confirm that the system is working and the issue was minor.

Whatever the outcome, you have done the right thing.
