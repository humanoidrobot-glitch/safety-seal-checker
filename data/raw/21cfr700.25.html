<body>
<h1>Sec. 700.25 Tamper-resistant packaging requirements for cosmetic products.</h1>

<p><strong>(a) General.</strong> Each manufacturer or packer who packages a cosmetic liquid oral hygiene product or vaginal product for retail sale shall package the product in a tamper-resistant package, if this product is accessible to the public while held for sale. A tamper-resistant package is one having an indicator or barrier to entry which, if breached or missing, can reasonably be expected to provide visible evidence to consumers that tampering has occurred. To reduce the likelihood of successful tampering and to increase the likelihood that consumers will discover if a product has been tampered with, the package is required to be distinctive by design (e.g., an aerosol product container) or by the use of one or more indicators or barriers to entry that employ an identifying characteristic (e.g., a pattern, name, registered trademark, logo, or picture).</p>

<p><strong>(b) Requirements for tamper-resistant package.</strong> In addition to the tamper-resistant packaging feature described in paragraph (a) of this section, each retail package of a cosmetic product covered by this section is required to bear a statement that is prominently placed so that consumers are alerted to the specific tamper-resistant feature of the package. The labeling statement is also required to be so placed that it will be unaffected if the tamper-resistant feature of the package is breached or missing. If the tamper-resistant feature chosen to meet the requirement in paragraph (a) of this section uses an identifying characteristic, that characteristic is required to be referred to in the labeling statement.</p>

<p><strong>(c) Request for exemptions from packaging and labeling requirements.</strong> A manufacturer or packer may request an exemption from the packaging and labeling requirements of this section. A request for an exemption is required to be submitted in the form of a citizen petition under Sec. 10.30 of this chapter and should be clearly identified on the envelope as a &quot;Request for Exemption from the Tamper-Resistant Packaging Rule for Cosmetic Products.&quot; The petition is required to contain the following:</p>

<p>(1) The name of the product or, if the petition seeks an exemption for a product class, the name of the product class, and a list of products within that class.</p>

<p>(2) The reasons that the product's compliance with the tamper-resistant packaging or labeling requirements of this section is unnecessary or cannot be achieved.</p>

<p>(3) A description of alternative steps that are available, or that the petitioner has already taken, to reduce the likelihood that the product or product class will be the subject of malicious adulteration.</p>

<p>(4) Other information justifying an exemption.</p>
