<h1>CPG Sec. 450.500 Tamper-Evident Packaging Requirements for Over-the-Counter (OTC) Human Drug Products</h1>

<h2>BACKGROUND:</h2>
<p>The tamper-evident packaging regulation for OTC drug products, 21 CFR 211.132, was originally issued in 1982 following the Tylenol poisoning incidents. The rule was revised in 1998 to strengthen packaging requirements.</p>

<h2>POLICY:</h2>
<p>FDA considers the following types of packaging to be tamper-evident:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Film wrappers</strong> — A transparent film is wrapped securely around an individual product or product container. The film must be cut or torn to open and remove the product.</li>
<li><strong>Blister or strip packs</strong> — The product and container are sealed in individual compartments formed from thermoformed plastic, clear or opaque. The backing material must be broken through or peeled off to access the product.</li>
<li><strong>Bubble packs</strong> — The product is enclosed in individual plastic bubbles affixed to a backing card. The bubble must be broken to remove the product.</li>
<li><strong>Shrink seals and bands</strong> — Preformed bands or wrappers with a heat-applied tight fit are placed around the closure or container. The seal must be torn or broken to open the container.</li>
<li><strong>Foil, paper, or plastic pouches</strong> — The product is enclosed in an individual pouch that must be torn or broken to obtain the product.</li>
<li><strong>Bottle seals</strong> — A paper, thermal, or plastic seal is bonded to the mouth of a container under the cap. The seal must be torn or broken to open the container and remove the product.</li>
<li><strong>Tape seals</strong> — Tape is applied over all carton flaps or bottle cap-to-container junctions. The tape must be torn or broken to open the container.</li>
<li><strong>Breakable caps</strong> — The container is sealed by a cap that either breaks upon opening or has a visible band that separates from the cap upon opening.</li>
<li><strong>Sealed tubes</strong> — The mouth of the tube is sealed and the seal must be punctured to access the product.</li>
<li><strong>Sealed cartons</strong> — All flaps of the carton are sealed and the carton must be visibly damaged upon opening.</li>
</ol>

<h2>REGULATORY ACTION GUIDANCE:</h2>
<p>Products not meeting tamper-evident packaging requirements may be subject to regulatory action. Manufacturers are expected to incorporate at least one tamper-evident feature and include a labeling statement alerting consumers. Products found in violation may be deemed adulterated under Section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or misbranded under Section 502.</p>
