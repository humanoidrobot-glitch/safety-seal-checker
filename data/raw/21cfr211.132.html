<head><title>21 CFR 211.132 - Tamper-Evident Packaging Requirements for OTC Human Drug Products</title></head>
<body>
<h1>Sec. 211.132 Tamper-evident packaging requirements for over-the-counter (OTC) human drug products.</h1>

<p><strong>(a) General.</strong> Each manufacturer and packer who packages an OTC drug product (except a dermatological, dentifrice, insulin, or lozenge product) for retail sale shall package the product in a tamper-evident package, if this product is accessible to the public while held for sale. A tamper-evident package is one having one or more indicators or barriers to entry which, if breached or missing, can reasonably be expected to provide visible evidence to consumers that tampering has occurred. To reduce the likelihood of successful tampering and to increase the likelihood that consumers will discover if a product has been tampered with, the package is required to be distinctive by design or by the use of one or more indicators or barriers to entry that employ an identifying characteristic (e.g., a pattern, name, registered trademark, logo, or picture). For purposes of this section, the term &quot;distinctive by design&quot; means the packaging cannot be duplicated with commonly available materials or through commonly used processes.</p>

<p><strong>(b) Requirements for tamper-evident package.</strong> (1) In addition to the tamper-evident packaging feature described in paragraph (a) of this section, each retail package of an OTC drug product covered by this section is required to bear a statement that is prominently placed so that consumers are alerted to the specific tamper-evident feature of the package. The labeling statement is also required to be so placed that it will be unaffected if the tamper-evident feature of the package is breached or missing.</p>

<p>(2) If the tamper-evident feature chosen to meet the requirement in paragraph (a) of this section uses an identifying characteristic, that characteristic is required to be referred to in the labeling statement. For example, the labeling statement on a bottle with a shrink band could say &quot;For your protection, this bottle has an imprinted seal around the neck.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>(c) Request for exemptions from packaging and labeling requirements.</strong> A manufacturer or packer may request an exemption from the packaging and labeling requirements of this section. A request for an exemption is required to be submitted in the form of a citizen petition under Sec. 10.30 of this chapter and should be clearly identified on the envelope as a &quot;Request for Exemption from Tamper-Evident Packaging Rule.&quot; The petition is required to contain the following:</p>

<p>(1) The name of the drug product or, if the petition seeks an exemption for a drug class, the name of the drug class, and a list of products within that class.</p>

<p>(2) The reasons that the drug product's compliance with the tamper-evident packaging or labeling requirements of this section is unnecessary or cannot be achieved.</p>

<p>(3) A description of alternative steps that are available, or that the petitioner has already taken, to reduce the likelihood that the product or drug class will be the subject of malicious adulteration.</p>

<p>(4) Other information justifying an exemption.</p>

<p><strong>(d) OTC drug products subject to approved new drug applications.</strong> Holders of approved new drug applications for OTC drug products are required under Sec. 314.70 of this chapter to provide the agency with a supplement to describe any changes in packaging to comply with the requirements of this section.</p>

<p><strong>(e) Poison Prevention Packaging Act of 1970.</strong> The requirements of this section are in addition to any requirements of the Poison Prevention Packaging Act of 1970.</p>
