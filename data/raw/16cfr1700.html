<h2>Sec. 1700.15 Poison prevention packaging standards.</h2>
<p>(a) In accordance with the act, the Commission has established requirements for the special packaging of hazardous household substances. The special packaging must meet child-resistant effectiveness specifications and must also comply with the applicable adult-use effectiveness specifications.</p>
<p>(b) The standards require that the packaging be tested in accordance with the protocols set forth in Sec. 1700.20.</p>

<h2>Sec. 1700.20 Testing procedure for special packaging.</h2>
<p>(a) Child-resistant effectiveness test. Special packaging shall be tested by sequential pairs of children to determine child resistance. The test requires 200 children between the ages of 42 and 51 months. The packaging passes the child-resistant test if not more than 20 percent of the children open it in the first 5-minute test period and not more than 20 percent open it in the total 10-minute test period.</p>
<p>(b) Adult-use effectiveness test. Special packaging shall also be tested to ensure that normal adults can open and close the packaging. The packaging passes the adult test if at least 90 percent of adults can open and properly close the package within 5 minutes.</p>
